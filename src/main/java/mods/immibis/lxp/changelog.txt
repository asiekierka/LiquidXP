57.1.2:
* Fixed the fluid name used for MFR's mob essence. Should fix compatibility with mob essence.

57.1.1:
* Fixed crash on startup (which was because I forgot to test a small change)

57.1.0:
* Probably added compatibility with OpenBlocks XP Juice. Machines should accept XP Juice as well as Liquid XP if OpenBlocks is installed. Not tested.
* Probably added compatibility with TE3 Reactant Dynamos. One bucket of LXP should produce 1,000,000 RF by default. Not tested.
* Fixed the default value of xpPerMobEssenceBucket (was 20, should be 15)
* Added config options to multiply XP cost of imprinters and combiners.

57.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.4.

56.0.2:
* Fixed GUI backgrounds.

56.0.1:
* Fixed crash on startup on servers.

56.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.2.
* Renamed glowing medallions to imbued medallions.
* Removed Greg code.
* Added creative tab for LXP machines and items.
* Now fully translatable.

55.1.6:
* Made more things configurable.
* A bucket of liquid XP is now worth 4 times the XP it was before.
  This means that liquid XP you have in tanks is now worth 4 times what it was, unless you change it back,
  and that you can move XP around 4 times as quickly, and store 4 times as much.
  This also means recipes are slightly more expensive.
* Changed liquid texture to be a normal texture in the JAR file with no special code.
  Probably fixes problems with Optifine and HD texture packs.

55.1.5:
* Combiners will not process items with invalid enchantments on them.
* Added trolling if your username is GregoriusT, disable-able with a java option.

55.1.4:
* Fixed MFR compatibility (not my fault, they gave me the wrong liquid name).

55.1.3:
* Fixed combiners not applying some enchantments that can be applied with an anvil.

55.1.2:
* Fixed some machines not dropping stored items when destroyed.
* Fixed obvious enchantment dupe bug with isolator!

55.1.1:
* Added "destroyXPOverflow" option.

55.1.0:
* Added LXP Isolator, which will take a book with multiple enchantments or an *undamaged* enchanted tool
  or armour piece, and transfer the enchantments to separate books.
  Costs a (relatively) small amount of LXP.
* Fixed sidedness of LXP Combiners.
* Untested compatibility with inputting MFR Mob Essence into machines instead of Liquid XP.
  One bucket of mob essence is worth two buckets of LXP.

55.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.2.

54.0.2:
* Liquid displays properly in BC tanks (and should display properly and not crash in RC tanks). Blame cpw for making a retarded API.

54.0.1:
* Fixed java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: recentlyHit
* Increased the area the enchanter will search for bookshelves.
* Added a display of the number of bookshelves in range to the Enchanter GUI.

54.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.1.

53.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.5.

52.0.7:
* You can now combine two enchanted books.

52.0.6:
* Added compatibility with RedPower fluid pipes, this is one of the few things you can do with RP2 without making Eloraam hate you.
* Fixed calculation of XP required to repair a tool using a raw material (eg: diamond pickaxe + diamonds -> repaired diamond pickaxe)

52.0.5:
* ???

52.0.4:
* You can fill glass bottles with Liquid XP with any normal bucket filling method to get Bottles of Enchanting.
  Throwing the bottle will return significantly less XP than was used to create it - on average, 80% will be wasted.

52.0.3:
* Fixed crash when using the Combiner on servers.

52.0.2:
* Now works on servers.
* Moved liquid texture to a separate sheet by itself.

* Removed testing feature that allowed you to create skeleton spawners.
* Fixed catalyzer crash.

52.0.0:
* Initial release.
